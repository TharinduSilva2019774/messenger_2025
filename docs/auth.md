# Authentication (Clerk)

## Overview
Clerk is used for user authentication in the frontend.

## How It Works
- Users sign up/sign in via Clerk UI
- Clerk provides user info and JWT tokens
- Protected pages/components check authentication state

## Key Files
- Clerk setup: see your Clerk dashboard and Next.js integration docs
- Usage in pages/components: look for Clerk hooks/components
